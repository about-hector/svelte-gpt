TO-DO: 

- [ ] homepage - I have 2 handlesubmits both in the form and in the autosizing 
searchbar component. I need to conciliate the 2
- [ ] add a navbar that only appears on mobile (replacing the drawer toggle with a burger inside this navbar)

- [ ] CSS reset from josh comeau
- [ ] Prerender what's not interactive/dynamic, it's better for SEO and delivery speed.
