TO-DO:
- sort chats by today, this week, and then monthly
- [ ] in the sidebar, the scrollbar appears on hover. on mobile it should work immediately.

- [ ] Home and chats have 2 handlesubmit events, one on the autosizing bar and one on the form. I need to repeat the code every time and every change must be changed everywhere. fix it for composability

- [ ] add a navbar that only appears on mobile (replacing the drawer toggle with a burger inside this navbar)

- [ ] CSS reset 
- [ ] Prerender what's not interactive/dynamic, it's better for SEO and delivery speed.
