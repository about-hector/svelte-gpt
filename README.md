TO-DO:

- [ ] chatTree
- [ ]Â when I press regenerate, a new message is created and added to the array
  but it duplicates the question and adds everything to the conversation rather
  than eliminating previous replies from the chat

- [ ] in the sidebar, the scrollbar appears on hover. on mobile it should work immediately.

- [ ] homepage - I have 2 handlesubmits both in the form and in the autosizing
      searchbar component. I need to conciliate the 2
- [ ] add a navbar that only appears on mobile (replacing the drawer toggle with a burger inside this navbar)

- [ ] CSS reset from josh comeau
- [ ] Prerender what's not interactive/dynamic, it's better for SEO and delivery speed.
